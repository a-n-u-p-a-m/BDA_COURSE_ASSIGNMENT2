# CONCEPT DRIFT ANALYSIS USING GAN

1. In this I have designed and trained a GAN model for generating synthetic data.
2. The Page Hinkley Test and KL-Divergence methods are used for real concept drift detection.
3. The Z-test for proportions is used for virtual concept drift detection between real data and synthetic data.
